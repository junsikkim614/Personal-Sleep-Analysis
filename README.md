##### This project explores my personal sleep data to identify the relationships between sleep duration, time in bed, and sleep quality. The analysis was conducted using sleep tracking data over multiple nights, with a focus on understanding the key factors that influence restful sleep 
**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Linear Regression 

**Key findings** : 
- Positive Correlation: A significant positive correlation (0.92) was found between time asleep and sleep quality, suggesting that longer sleep duration strongly improves sleep quality.
- Time in Bed and Sleep Quality: A regression model revealed that I need to be in bed for at least 8.4 hours to achieve a minimum of 85% sleep quality. This highlights the importance of allocating sufficient time in bed to improve sleep outcomes.
- Multivariate Analysis: Additional factors such as steps, movements per hour, and heart rate were included in a multivariate regression. Time asleep was identified as the most significant factor impacting sleep quality, while heart rate was not statistically significantpandemic.
